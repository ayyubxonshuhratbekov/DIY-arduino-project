# DIY-arduino-project
Hi, everyone. I made an Arduino microprocessor-based project that could turn the light on or off when you clap your hands or just make some sound. Everything single line of code in c++ is explained. It is a beginner friendly. I included visual overview of the project and schematic  Hope you will find the project to be useful. Thanks!
